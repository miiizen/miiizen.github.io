A couple of years ago, I was asked to create a website for my sixth form's school magazine.  
I decided to use [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/), as I had previous experience working with it.  Although web development wasn't (and never will be) my favourite thing, I thought I'd give it a go.
### Some features
 - Pagination (through some Razor in a template)
 - Categories
 - Search - Umbraco has a library called [Examine](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Reference/Searching/Examine/) which uses Lucene for indexing and searching
 - Authors - Using Umbraco as my CMS made it easy to add user accounts with different permissions.  We had an editor and a content writer who could publish articles from their accounts. The correct author was credited at the foot of the article.

In the end, the magazine didn't work out and wasn't particularly used for a variety of reasons, but it was a good opportunity for me to create a site and negotiate hosting it.
