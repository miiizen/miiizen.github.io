‘I Found Rhythm (I could ask for more)’ presents Gershwin’s song ‘I got Rhythm’ in an unfamiliar setting.  ‘I Got Rhythm’ has been endlessly reimagined over the years, its harmonic progression appearing in many swing & bebop contrafacts such as “Anthropology”, “Cottontail” & “Rhythm-A-Ning”.  Characteristic rhythms from Gershwin’s song are gradually uncovered from a series of still sonorities before becoming rhythmically and harmonically warped like an old record, with crawling strings upsetting the wind’s soli.
