"Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe!”, shouted by Plutus, is the opening phrase of Canto IV of Dante’s Inferno. The pitch material of the piece has been derived from this nonsense phrase. This circle of Hell is filled with two groups of people: those who hoarded wealth while alive, and those who frittered money away. They heave boulders at each other, this back and forth informing some of the dialogue in the piece.
