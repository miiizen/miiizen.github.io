Tolling the Devil’s Knell is a tradition which takes place at Dewsbury minster, West Yorkshire.  It began in 1434 after a local knight, Thomas de Soothill, murdered a servant boy after hearing he had not attended church that week.  To repent for this murder, he paid for a new tenor bell at the minster and requested it be rung on Christmas Eve, one toll for every year since the birth of Jesus.  De Soothill's soul is still being prayed for to this day as the tradition has continued over the years to signify the “defeat of evil” and repent for all of humanity’s sins.
