title: "GSoC 2022 - Harp pedalling week 2"
---

Hi everyone,

This won't be a hugely interesting post I'm afraid as the time I've spent on the project this week has been mostly essential work behind the scenes. Through this I've learned a lot more about how the engraving internals work and interact with each other.
I also added a palette section for new harp notation. For now, this will just be the pedalling diagrams, but there are many other pieces of harp notation we could add in the future. Here's an image from the mockup as I haven't quite got to displaying the actual diagram yet.

## Next steps
Next week I'll finally get to displaying a diagram in the score and have some more exciting images to show you!
