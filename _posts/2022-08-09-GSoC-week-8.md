Hi,

This week was spent tidying up the last bits relevent to the MVP.  Unfortunately, the placement of the diagram on the score is proving difficult and isn't quite finished yet.  
I talked to a few harp players, looked through some music and had a go on a pedal harp (which was quite difficult - not an option for a career change!) to give me a feel for where pedal changes should be placed "horizonally" on a score.  Damping of the strings needs to be taken into account, and different harpists have different opinions on how much warning to give.  This will be helpful if/when I get to creating an automatic pedalling function.  

## Next steps
Next week I will continue trying to get the popup placed correctly on the score.  I'd also like to move onto thinking about a proofreading function, as I think I'll be able to fit it in comfortably with the time left before September and the end of GSoC.
