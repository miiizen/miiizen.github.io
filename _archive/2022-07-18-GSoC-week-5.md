Hello all,

I tidied up the last bits of the harp pedalling diagrams you will see in the score this week - they are ready to go and the changes can be seen in this [pull request](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/pull/12269).  
I have also made a start on the popup editor for the diagrams.  These popup dialogues will be used for many different elements, so I've been trying to make them as generic as possible for a wide variety of future use cases.  There are many more bits to add before this is anywhere near usuable so no pictures this week I'm afraid!

## Next steps

This week I'll be getting the generic popups to a usable point.  From there it should be fairly straightforward to build the harp UI and allow it to edit the diagrams seen in the score.
