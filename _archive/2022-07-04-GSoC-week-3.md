Hello everyone,

This week, I have finally made some tangible progress within the program!  The harp palette has been added and the pedalling diagrams can be placed in the score.  Currently it is only possible to add the graphic diagrams, not the text versions, and they remain uneditable for the moment.

The style and placement of the diagram is currently temporary - I'll need to consult the engraving team to make sure the diagrams appear at the correct size and position.  

## Next steps

This week I'll finish off text diagrams and make some other small improvements before starting on the UI used to edit the diagrams.
