Hi,

This week has been productive in getting my branch rebased and fixing some layout problems.  There are still some edge cases to work out, but the UI is looking much better.  I've also included some missing functionality linking all diagrams in a score.  When one diagram is edited, the score is searched for text settings further ahead.  If they need to change, the diagram text is "calculated" again and updated.  

My final tasks for the diagram are tidying up UI placement and fixing tests.  Unfortunately I hadn't noticed that the CI wasn't running due to merge conflicts in my PR.  I had been putting off resolving these until the PR was almost ready to merge which proved to be a mistake!  Some issues have appeared which I wasn't expecting but these have had simple fixes so far.
